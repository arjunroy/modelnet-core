Modelnet Linux Sample Install : From Start to Finish

The following document contains the installation instructions for Modelnet,
assuming one linux system used as the emulator and two linux systems used
as the clients.

* Set up OS on clients and emulators
In this installation run, we use Ubuntu 10.04 for all systems. Simply install
and setup a stock Ubuntu installation on all systems.

* Acquire a copy of the Modelnet code.

* Optionally, set up MODELNET_PREFIX and GEXEC_PREFIX variables.
The Makefiles included in this project default to MODELNET_PREFIX=/opt/modelnet
and GEXEC_PREFIX=/opt/scaletools if they are not otherwise defined. Note that
all systems in use must agree on the values for these variables.

* On the client systems, compile and install libipaddr.so.
From the root directory of the modelnet source:
$ cd client
$ make clean
$ make
$ sudo make install 

* On the emulator system, compile and install the kernel module.
From the root directory of the modelnet source:
$ cd emulator/linux/module
$ make clean
$ make
$ sudo make install
