Modelnet README

modelnet.txt, modelnet.pdf and modelnet.html are all different formats of
the same document: a thorough description of what Modelnet is, and how to 
install it on the older FreeBSD 4.x operating system.

LINUX_QUICKSTART is a detailed description of how to get Modelnet running on
Ubuntu 10.04.

FREEBSD_QUICKSTART is a detailed description of how to get Modelnet running on
a more current version of FreeBSD.

Recommended reading order is modelnet.txt (or .pdf or .html) first to get an 
idea of what Modelnet is all about, followed by LINUX_QUICKSTART or 
FREEBSD_QUICKSTART to actually get it running on a modern platform.
