To run the example file, perform the following steps:

1. Generate the graph file from the provided inet file
$ cat sample.inet | inet2xml -p 100 among 25 stubs > sample.graph

2. Generate the route file from the graph
$ allpairs sample.graph > sample.route

3. Create the model file from the graph and hosts file
$ mkmodel sample.graph sample.hosts > sample.model

4. Deploy the network

Either deploy on each host manually like so:

$ deployhost sample.model sample.route

OR: Setup gexecd and authd on all hosts, and use deploy:

$ deploy sample.model sample.route

Alternatively, use the existing model and route files in backup/.
