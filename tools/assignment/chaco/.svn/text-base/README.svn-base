This directory contains all the necessary source code files
for Chaco.  Simply type "make", and the code will be compiled
and the executable image placed in "../exec/chaco".  

The default values for the user accessible parameters discussed 
in the user's guide "doc/User_guide.ps" can be modified by 
editing the file "main/user_params.c".  You must recompile for 
these changes to take affect. 

You can also change the code parameters at run time (i.e. without 
recompiling) by including a file "User_Params" in whichever 
directory you are running the code from (so in the file 
"exec/User_Params" in our orignal set-up). Parameter changes 
can be specified in a natural way in this file using the rules 
described in the user's guide.
