# This is an example of a flow pattern description.
# "peer" is the only declared client class, so all
# clients will be in the class "peer."
# Members of "peer" will have link bandwidths between 1 and 10,
# and each will have 10 flows to other "peer"s, each
# of which will use as much bandwidth as possible.
