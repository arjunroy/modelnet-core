  <heading>Deploying a Model Network</heading>
  <p>
    Once the model and route files are created, the emulation cluster can
    be configured to be the virtual network.  Root access on all machines
    is required for this operation.  With a handful of machines, it is
    feasible to manually setup Modelnet. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Modelnet requires all machines in the emulation cluster have the
    <url id="http://search.cpan.org/author/GRANTM/XML-Simple-2.07/lib/XML/Simple.pm" name="XML::Simple"> perl module installed.
  </p>

  <sect>
  <heading>Sudo support</heading>

  <p>
    Root access is required to deploy a network topology. 
    Using sudo, this access can be fine
    tuned and password-free.   The deploy scripts assume sudo is
    configured on each machine used for Modelnet.   
  </p>

  <p>
    For controlled access, the /etc/sudoers (or /usr/local/etc/sudoers
    on FreeBSD) can specify the Modelnet commands.
    Add these lines to sudoers, for password-free access:
    <example>
    Host_Alias      MODELHOSTS = larry moe curly
    User_Alias      MODELERS =  login names go here  
    Cmnd_Alias MODELCMDS = /sbin/ifconfig, /sbin/route, \
            /sbin/kldload, /sbin/kldunload, /sbin/ipfw, /sbin/sysctl, \
	    /usr/local/bin/modelload, /usr/local/bin/ipfwload
    MODELERS MODELHOSTS = NOPASSWD: MODELCMDS
    </example>
    To test your sudo access, do <tt>sudo -l</tt>
  </p>

  <sect>
  <heading>Manual Deployment</heading>

  <p>
    Modelnet can be deployed by logging in to each host, and running the
    <tt>deployhost</tt> command.  This commond configures all the
    virtual IP addresses, routes, and loads the topology into the emulator.
    <example>
    deployhost example.model example.route
    </example>
    Once <tt>deployhost</tt> has run on every machine in the hosts file,
    the system is ready to emulate the virtual network.
  </p>


  <sect id=autodeploy>
  <heading>Automated Deployment</heading>

  <p>
  For large emulations, deployment can be automated as a
  a single command when gexec remote access to the cluster is available.
  See <ref id="build_gexec">.
    <example>
    deploy example.model example.route
    </example>
  The <tt>deploy</tt> can be run on any node in the <tt>gexec</tt> cluster.
  </p>
